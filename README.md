## Spotify Marketing Insights
Analyzing Listening Behavior to Inform Artist Discovery & Marketing Strategy

## Project Overview
This project explores how listener behavior and audio features influence track popularity on Spotify, with the goal of uncovering insights relevant to artist marketing, playlist strategy, and consumer discovery. Using a large Spotify tracks dataset, I analyze patterns across popularity tiers, audio characteristics, and genres to translate data-driven findings into actionable marketing recommendations.

## Dataset
- Source: Spotify Tracks Dataset (Kaggle)
- Size: ~114,000 tracks
Key Features Used:
- Popularity
- Danceability
- Energy
- Valence
- Tempo
- Track Genre
Popularity is used as a proxy for listener reach and engagement.

## Key Analyses & Insights
1. Danceability Across Popularity Tiers
Tracks in higher popularity tiers tend to exhibit higher median danceability compared to low and mid popularity tracks. This suggests that rhythm-forward songs may perform better in discovery-focused campaigns and playlist placements aimed at broad audience engagement.
2. Energy vs Track Popularity
Higher-energy tracks appear more frequently among popular songs, though the relationship is not strictly linear. Energy contributes to discovery and engagement, but successful performance likely depends on a combination of audio features, genre alignment, and marketing support.
3. Top Genres by Average Popularity
Pop-adjacent and mood-driven genres (e.g., pop-film, K-pop, chill, sad) demonstrate higher average popularity. The presence of globally influenced genres such as K-pop and Indian music highlights opportunities for culturally targeted marketing and international discovery strategies.
